PIL 23 - Summer Internship 

Problem Statement - 
Design and implement a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm for
task scheduling in a collaborative robotic
system, with a focus on package
transportation within warehouses. The goal is
to improve efficiency and reduce the number
of deadlocks, while operating in a
non-deterministic environment.

Proposed Solution - 
We propose to use a variant of Q-learning,
such as Independent or Cooperative
Q-Learning, to train a team of robots to work
together to transport packages. The robots will
learn from their interactions with the
environment and each other, and will be able to
adapt to changes in the environment and task
requirements. Deadlock avoidance will be
incorporated into the learning process to reduce
the number of deadlocks.
